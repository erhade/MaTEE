10. 	GOVERNMENT REQUIREMENTS
10.1	To the extent that you are an agency, contractor or instrumentality of the U.S. Government, you and we agree that:

Arm acknowledges that, whilst commercial computer software or commercial computer software documentation shall be acquired under licenses customarily provided to the public, such licenses must be consistent with U.S. Federal law and otherwise satisfy the U.S. Government's needs ("U.S. Government Requirements"); and
(b)  you may assign your rights under this License to the relevant US Government Federal Department or the successor contractor designated by the US Government Federal Department upon termination of your related prime contract with that US Government Federal Department. If you exercise your rights under this clause 10.1(b), you acknowledge and agree that you shall remain liable to Arm in respect of all your obligations under this License.

10.2	If there is any material inconsistency between (i) either a U.S. Government Requirement or a requirement of another government with which Arm is mandated by statute to comply and (ii) any provision of this License, the terms of the relevant government requirement shall prevail and the provision in question shall be deemed varied or deleted (as applicable) as required by the terms of the relevant government requirement. For the avoidance of doubt, in such circumstances, all other terms, conditions and provisions of this License will continue to be valid to the fullest extent permitted by law in accordance with the below clause 12.3.

7. 	TERM AND TERMINATION

8.	GENERAL
8.1	This License is governed by English Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that you are an agency, contractor or instrumentality of the U.S. Government, disputes arising under or relating to this License shall be decided under the U.S. federal law of government contracting, including without limitation the Contract Disputes Act. Nothing in this License shall prevent you from enforcing your intellectual property rights or seeking injunctive or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties hereby disclaim application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act.

8.2	Except where Arm agrees otherwise in (i) a written contract signed by you and Arm, or (ii) a written contract provided by Arm and accepted by you, this is the only agreement between you and Arm relating to the Arm Tools and it may only be modified by written agreement between you and Arm. No terms and conditions contained in any purchase order or other document issued by you, or any advertising or other representation by you or any third party shall add to, supersede or in any way vary the terms and conditions of this License. This License (and any documents expressly incorporated into it by reference herein) represents the entire agreement between you and Arm in relation to its subject matter. 

8.3	If any clause or sentence in this License is held by a court of law to be illegal or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of this License shall not be affected. Any failure by Arm to enforce any of the provisions of this License, unless waived in writing, shall not constitute a waiver of Arm's rights to enforce such provision or any other provision of this License in the future.
